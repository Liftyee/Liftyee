### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Making, tinkering, hacking...
Probably routing PCBs, soldering, or coding (C#, C++ or Python).
I like designing the next electronics project for Team Firefly and teaching younger students the fundamentals of designing an electronic system from scratch.
I dislike trying to hand solder tiny QFN integrated circuits.
