### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Making, tinkering, hacking...
Probably routing PCBs, soldering, or coding (C#, C++ or Python).
I like creating projects and teaching students the fundamentals of engineering. 
I also like 3M Commandâ„¢ adhesive strips.
I dislike trying to hand solder tiny QFN integrated circuits.
